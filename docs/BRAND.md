## Short description (use in README and UI)

Samvada Studio — a power-user workspace for designing, testing, and managing conversational AI across multiple LLM providers.

## Long description (for docs and marketing)

Samvada Studio is a polished authoring environment for conversational AI. It combines powerful editing workflows (inline editing, drafts, templates), multi-provider orchestration, and export/backup features to help creators, prompt engineers, and teams build reliable conversational experiences. Samvada Studio sits as the creation module in the future Samvada Suite, which will include experimentation and enterprise connector modules.

## Taglines (pick one)

- "Samvada Studio — Build and refine conversations across LLMs"
- "Samvada Studio — A power-user workspace for prompts and responses"

## Tone and usage notes

- Use "Samvada Studio" (title case) for UI and marketing copy.
- Use `samvada-studio` (kebab-case) for package names and identifiers.
- When referencing the broader product family, use "Samvada Suite" and list modules as: Studio, Labs, Hub, Forge (if/when built).

## Etymology & Authentic Forms

- IAST (scholarly): Saṃvāda Studio
- Devanagari: संवाद स्टूडियो

`Saṃvāda` (Saṃvādaḥ) is a Sanskrit word meaning "dialogue" or "conversation" derived from the prefix `saṃ-` (together) and the root `vad` (to speak). We honor the origin by including the scholarly IAST form and the Devanagari script in our brand materials and explaining the pronunciation and meaning alongside the product name.

Pronunciation guide: Saṃvāda — /suhm-VAH-dah/ (stress on the second syllable).

Usage recommendation: use the ASCII `Samvada Studio` for UI and technical identifiers; include `Saṃvāda (संवाद)` once in the README and `docs/BRAND.md` as an etymology note for clarity and respect.

## One-liner roadmap text (for README)

Samvada Studio is the first module of the Samvada Suite (coming soon). Future modules may include Samvada Labs (experimentation) and Samvada Hub (enterprise connectors).
